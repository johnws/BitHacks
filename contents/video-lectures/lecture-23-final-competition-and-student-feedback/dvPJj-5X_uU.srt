10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,580
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Welcome
to the final competition.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,060
So you guys survived this far.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,160
And I don't know how.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,760
I think, probably, with
very little sleep.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,690
And knowing all the emails that
I have seen and all the

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,060
check-ins.--

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,845
I don't know how many
people had--

17
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,960
Who had any sleep within
last 24 hours?

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
AUDIENCE: Haha.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,560
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Oh, OK.

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,946
[LAUGHTER]

21
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:44,650
OK.

22
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,000
And also what we looked at was
the quality of the results

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,300
keep improving because he was
running tests to check

24
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,270
what's going on.

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,550
And when we moved to
a machine, the

26
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,490
things ran very fast.

27
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,660
We're like, wait a minute.

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,690
Why is this running that fast?

29
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,010
Because people had checked in
more and more, faster and

30
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,750
faster versions.

31
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,120
So things improved, not because
we checked in faster

32
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,470
machines, but you guys actually
did a lot of work.

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,300
So first before we
get started, I

34
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,630
want to thank Akamai.

35
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,900
So we and Akamai got
this nice place.

36
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,110
And then we are going
to give a demo.

37
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,630
And we're going to have a party
sponsored by Akamai,

38
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,300
which is really cool.

39
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,890
So you guys actually
see something--

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,810
what the real-life people who
care about performance do.

41
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,850
So it will be really fun.

42
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,640
And also, I also want to thank
most of our MIT POSSE that

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,850
help you guys a lot in meeting
with you individually.

44
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,580
So we have people from Akamai,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

45
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,580
Digital, Google, Lockheed
Martin, MathWorks, Wordica,

46
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,560
VMWare and couple of independent
consultants who

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,360
basically put lot of their
sweat and edge

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,230
in helping you guys.

49
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,185
CHARLES LEISERSON:
And Microsoft.

50
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:53,400
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
And Microsoft.

51
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,750
CHARLES LEISERSON: So let's
give a hand for

52
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,226
the posse, MIT POSSE.

53
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:56,719
[LAUGHTER]

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,170
CHARLES LEISERSON: And a
couple of the sponsors.

55
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,050
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So here
is the process we

56
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,090
are going to do today.

57
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,620
Today's about the competition.

58
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,919
So we've set up a very strict
set of rules that we are going

59
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,410
to go through, which is not
going to be the way we are

60
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,690
going to grade you guys.

61
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,260
Because we are going to be
little bit more lenient.

62
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,820
So this is the set of rules
we are going to do.

63
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,960
So we had a lot of these images
that you get submitted.

64
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,830
And some images were
not exactly same.

65
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,970
People did little bit things.

66
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,330
They made them look little
bit different.

67
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,355
So what they said was instead
of we're deciding.

68
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:35,790
We will let you guys work on
images which can participate.

69
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,340
OK?

70
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,330
So don't be harsh
to your friends.

71
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,100
So what we'll do, we'll first
go through the images.

72
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,630
And then well you guys can say
which images should be part of

73
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,610
the competition.

74
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,900
This is for the competition.

75
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,650
Then at the end, after you get
the Akamai sponsored prize--

76
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,770
not for the grading.

77
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,440
So the fact that the images
start to count, that doesn't

78
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,080
mean you get zero
in the grade.

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,070
But you won't get to
participate in the

80
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,820
competition.

81
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,670
So after that, what
we have done is we

82
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,770
looked at all your projects.

83
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,830
Ran them on our 12
core machine.

84
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,320
And we will show you
and seed them.

85
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,980
We'll say here is the order
of everything happening.

86
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,310
And there are--

87
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,747
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

88
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:24,310
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
There are some--

89
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,850
Basically, what we'll do is
we'll pick out the top set of

90
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,410
seeds in them because
we don't have time

91
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,850
to run through everybody.

92
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,780
And basically, a lot of these
things live are not for the 48

93
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,980
core machine.

94
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,750
And then the--

95
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,680
accepted image that ran faster,
got generated faster

96
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,680
in the 48 core machine,
wins the prize.

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,660
So that doesn't mean that when
you start grading, we will

98
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,060
look at all the images and we
will do some averaging.

99
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,870
We will do a lot more fair.

100
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,900
But hey, this is
a competition.

101
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,850
We just need to find the top
guy so we have a top group.

102
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,380
So we have a much more
faster thing.

103
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,940
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So
to get started.

104
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,100
So here are some of the images
people generated.

105
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,530
So what we want to do is show
the reference image.

106
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,830
That's the reference image.

107
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,715
And what we'll do is we'll first
go through everybody's

108
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:17,430
images generated, so you
get a feel for all the

109
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,800
variations out there.

110
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,820
And then after that, we'll
ask you to go out.

111
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,010
We'll ask you if you don't
want that image

112
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,170
to be part of this.

113
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,390
[LAUGHTER]

114
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,400
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: You'll see.

115
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,870
OK.

116
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,420
So this is the reference
image.

117
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,840
Why don't you go through--

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,210
Charles.

119
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,580
Mike.

120
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,290
AUDIENCE: Yep?

121
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,820
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Why
don't you go through

122
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,870
the rest of the images.

123
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,140
AUDIENCE: OK.

124
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,120
So before we we get into the
images that we actually

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
rendered in the last few hours,
I just wanted to like

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,990
honorable mention for this.

127
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,170
I think this is the coolest.

128
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,570
I'm sure you guys have been
looking at a whole variety of

129
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,930
broken ray tracer images But I
think this is pretty much the

130
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,840
coolest thing I've seen.

131
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,040
So honorable mention for that.

132
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,390
And so now let's look
at things that

133
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,645
people actually submitted.

134
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,400

135
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,910
First we're going to go through
all the images and

136
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,910
sort of look at the range.

137
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,060
And then we'll go back
and vote on them.

138
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,760
And so I'm just going to flip
through the ones on the right

139
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,866
and give a couple
seconds to each.

140
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:21,990
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So
see if they can

141
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,522
identify the artifacts.

142
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:28,826
AUDIENCE: Which one?

143
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:31,120
CHARLES LEISERSON: You got to
say when you're going because

144
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,750
otherwise people aren't going
to realize that you've been

145
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,900
through three of them already.

146
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,986
Here's image one.

147
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,153
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Image--

148
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,800
AUDIENCE: Here's the next one.

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,161
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Image two.

150
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:42,590
CHARLES LEISERSON:
That's five.

151
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,430
Four, five.

152
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,732
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
Image three.

153
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:59,142
image four, image five, image
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

154
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:09,410
11, SAMAN AMARASINGHE: 12,
13, 14, 15, OK, 15.

155
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,535
There are some groups that we
could not get the rendering.

156
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:15,450
Either it crashed, or after
ten minutes it was still

157
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,420
hadn't produced an image.

158
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,240
So they're not a part
of the competition.

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,230
And of course we run them
for the finals.

160
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,120
OK, now the vote time.

161
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,830
OK, so this image, in or out?

162
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,800
Who thinks out?

163
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,830
Whoa, you guys are
a harsh crowd.

164
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,710
OK.

165
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,160
[LAUGHTER]

166
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,080
CHARLES LEISERSON:
Who thinks in?

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,832
Who thinks in?

168
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:34,160
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
Who thinks in?

169
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,700
CHARLES LEISERSON: We've
got to get you both.

170
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,100
Who thinks in?

171
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,460
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
So we know--

172
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,460
AUDIENCE: Do we get
screwed for this?

173
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,280
[LAUGHTER]

174
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,070
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
Imagine that.

175
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,862
OK.

176
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:43,250

576
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,020
So I guess for the display
surface, the main optimization

577
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,060
there was imagining two planes
at the top bound and the

578
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,900
bottom bound and seeing if a
ray passed through them and

579
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,560
then only checking that
section of the grid.

580
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,300
And then even within like that
square bounding box--

581
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,322
AUDIENCE: Like if there's a
square, and then the ray's

582
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:46,036
going through like
that, there's a

583
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:46,750
bunch of grid squares--

AUDIENCE: Could you use
the mic, please?

585
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:50,955
AUDIENCE: Like if a ray's
intersecting a square, there's

586
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,700
still a bunch of grid squares
above and below it that you

587
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,490
don't have to check.

588
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,310
So we kind of imagined
it as a--

589
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,370
projected it onto
a 2D surface.

590
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,530
So we didn't check additional
superfluous grid squares.

591
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,540
We also did the thing where
we got rid of the trig by

592

transforming from polar
coordinates to XYZ

Although, before that, we used
the fast sign and cosign

approximation, which
was almost as fast.

It's already recording.

665
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,630
So for the cache I use like
a three-dimensional grid.

666
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,420
Because I realized that as the
old times, the torrents is

667
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,910
like usually one, unless
there's some outlier.

668
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,820
But I don't see one
in my case.

669
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,950
So I use a three-dimensional
grid.

670
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,240
And use a lot of locks to
prevent contention.

671
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,780
So I do the same thing
for photon map.

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,470
I basically implement my
own photon map and

673
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,650
just get rid of theirs.

674
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,940
And also, the same thing,
like using a grid.

675
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,300
And I spent a lot of
time debugging.

minor optimization.

678
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,870
We implement the rendering
crest as a reducer.

679
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,112
So that we--

680
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:17,820
a hyper rod object So that every
time Cilk steals some

681
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,340
other's job, you will create
a local view of

682
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,650
the rendered object.

683
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:28,200
And we found there is a artifact
that-- because we are

684
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,750
seeding the rendered object.

685
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,090
The default that seed
is two, right?

686
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,810
And it will create some artifact
in our image, so we

687
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,780
use a random number to seed
that rendered object.

688
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,750
That's what we do.

689
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,050
And also, we do something
like we change the--

690
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,363
no, we don't have
locate photon.

691
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:53,610

692
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,620
Yeah OK.

693
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,310
So we have done a lot of thing
to improve the original photon

694
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,415
med but after that we decide to
change our implementation

695
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,145
of photon med so we
don't use that.

696

697
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,450

things that happened is that

708
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,700
we looked at the code and, like,
it was all a KD tree.

709
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,980
And we're like, what's that?

710
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,330

immediately and we turned it

I think the other groups might
have talked about it, but we

713
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,750
gave it a nifty marketing
name, we

714
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,470
called it a photon cube.

715
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,310
And so we created
lots of these.

716
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,070
We partitioned the large cube
environment into many small

717
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,260
photon cubes so we could just
jump in and look in the

718
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,860
relative air vicinity
of photons that

719
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,630
you're looking for.

720
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,850
STUDENT 9: Yeah.

721
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:06,490
So this is like, when you do
locate photon, you know the

722
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,070
reference photon and you
can create a sphere.

723
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:15,360
So we can do constant time to
find the boundary of the

724
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,810
photon cube.

725
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:22,400
Like go from x1 to x something,
y to y and z to z.

726
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,790
So then we don't have to
traverse the tree.

727
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:30,280
And we basically parallelized
two part, so the one in render

728
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,750
and another one in the trace
photon that when we try to put

729
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,180
the photon in the map.

730
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,030
And also when we create a photon
to the cube, there is a

731
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,170
reused vector to start a
photon in each cube.

732
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,770
But then it's not really good,
because when you put the

733
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,510
photon in the cube, you have
to, like, new photon.

734
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,410
Which means that the memory,
it's like spurts throughout

735
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,860
your program.

736
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,190
So after that we convert that
into a block of memory.

737
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,805
And we use that when we
call locate photon.

738
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:08,390

739
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:13,485
STUDENT 10: And for the last,
about surfaces that intersect.

740
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:16,450

741
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,930
There were four kinds
of optimizations.

742
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:27,140
First one is checking if the
origin of ray is outside of

743
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,980
the maximum bound and lower
bound of surface, then and

744
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:40,930
check whether by direction is
outside or if it's toward the

745
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,480
outside then we don't have to
check, just return false.

746
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,280
And second thing is like
the square cube thing.

747
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:58,220
When rays intersect we can make
a boundary by directly

748
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:06,330
mapping to the XYZ at the
surface at the maximum

749
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,530
boundary and lower boundary
of the surface.

750
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:18,850
And also when you iterate
through the x index, we can

751
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:27,930
cut off again because
a bitmap.

752
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:35,680
We only have to check with the
indexes which correspond to

753
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,880
ray's z index at that cube,
at that x location.

754
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:50,510
And the last thing was for each
square we pre-computed

755
00:27:50,510 --> 00:28:02,200
the minimum value and maximum
value of y and we compared the

756
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,890
rays by value within
that range.

757
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,755
And we just cut off if
it doesn't intersect.

758
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:15,413
It doesn't overlap.

759
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:16,400
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

760
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,250
Good.

761
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,120
OK, now this is the
suspense part.

762
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,550
OK.

763
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,240
We are going to run
this and see.

764
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,090
The time to beat is 18.7.

765
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:24,900
OK, right?

766
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,630
Again.

767
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,460
OK.

768
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,140
There we go.

769
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,560
Let's see.

770
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,040
How many people think it's
going to beat 18.7.

771
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,660
18.6.

772
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,510
OK.

773
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,070
AUDIENCE: 8, 9, 10--

774
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,530
PROFESSOR 1: It's
the excitement.

775
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,370
Keep counting.

776
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:36,900
OK.

777
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,550
There we go.

778
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:44,890
AUDIENCE: 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19--

779
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,020
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, oh, oh.

780
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:52,960
AUDIENCE: 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26.

781
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,260
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, OK.

782
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,170
It came out as 26.41.

783
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:57,790
OK.

784
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,070
[APPLAUSE]

785
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,150
PROFESSOR 1: So you guys
are the winners.

786
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,400
Come up here.

787
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,620

788
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,110
AUDIENCE: Danielle.

789
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,222
PROFESSOR 1: Where's Danielle?

790
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:17,614
AUDIENCE: Uh, Danielle
disappeared.

791
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,854
AUDIENCE: Yes, she did.

792
00:29:19,854 --> 00:29:20,550
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

793
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,250
Let's see whether she
can find her, so OK.

794
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,650
Just hold on a second until--

795
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,740

796
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,990
AUDIENCE: Yep, there we go.

797
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:36,540

798
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,395
PROFESSOR 1: You can put
it down now, though.

799
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:41,810

800
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,560
PRESENTER: So this one's
the reference.

801
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,820
PROFESSOR 1: Put a text meter
in, that's better.

802
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,680
AUDIENCE: Which one's
reference?

803
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,930
PRESENTER: This one's
the reference.

804
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:52,780

805
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,880
PROFESSOR 1: I think
they don't align.

806
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,200
Can you align them?

807
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,070
PRESENTER: There we go.

808
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,180
PROFESSOR 1: OK, so we
have a winning team.

809
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,070
PROFESSOR 2: We have
a winning team.

810
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,870
And so it's my pleasure to
introduce Danielle Smith, who

811
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:19,220
is the University relations for
Akamai, and she's here to

812
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,980
give you guys your prize.

813
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,671
So we have three winners.

814
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,770
DANIELLE: I just wanted
to make an entrance

815
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,640
is why I came in.

816
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,160
Thank you.

817
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,900
First of all, welcome to all of
you guys for coming in, and

818
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,610
we wanted to give you
these prizes.

819
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:38,810
So we have some cool iPod Nanos,
which you may or may

820
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,720
not have already, but it can't
hurt to have another.

821
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,780

822
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,690
They kind of burn out
or you lose one or

823
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,946
someone steps on it.

824
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:55,610
[APPLAUSE]

825
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,790
DANIELLE: Congratulations.

826
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,230
You guys have worked
really hard.

827
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,000

828
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,120
PROFESSOR 1: Congratulations.

829
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,140
Congratulations.

830
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,740
Congratulations.

831
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,410
OK.

832
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,150
So what's next.

833
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:11,970
That's it.

834
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:12,790
We are done?

835
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,120
DANIELLE: All righty.

836
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,600
So we have plenty of food,
it's going to be

837
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,270
right on the atrium.

838
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,370
I know that's the most
exciting part.

839
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,690
But it should be arriving in the
next 10 to 15 minutes, so

840
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,260
we have a few minutes.

841
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,230
I thought maybe this would
go a little bit longer.

842
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,180
PROFESSOR 1: We do
have a couple of

843
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,900
things we can chat about.

844
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,400
DANIELLE: Yeah.

845
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,510
So just a couple of housekeeping
things.

846
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,810
If you need to use the ladies'
room or the men's room, it's

847
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,040
actually right outside
that door.

848
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,050
Out the double doors, you'll
see it right there.

849
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,150
I have invited some other Akamai
employees to come and

850
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,840
mingle and say hello to you
guys, so I encourage you, if

851
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,120
you see any faces that aren't
familiar, to kind of go up and

852
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,310
talk about your projects
and introduce yourself.

853
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,480
And thanks for coming.

854
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,230
I know we wanted to switch it up
a little bit because it was

855
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,040
the last class.

856
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,140
We wanted to get you out of the
classroom and just kind of

857
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,670
shake it up.

858
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,490
So I'm glad that you
came to join.

859
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,050
PROFESSOR 1: And the
knock tours.

860
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,230
DANIELLE: And the knock tours.

861
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,660
Thank you.

862
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,160
So on the back of your name
tags, there's a number, one,

863
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,410
two or three.

864
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,100

865
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,950
One, two or three.

866
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,120
So that correlates with
the knock tour that

867
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,310
you're going to be on.

868
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,240
We have to keep it to relatively
small groups.

869
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,620
So the first tour will be at 10
past 4, the second one will

870
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,840
be at 4:40, and the last
one will be at 5:10.

871
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,550
PROFESSOR 1: I guess if we don't
have too many people we

872
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,000
might be able to
compress some--

873
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,440
DANIELLE: Yes.

874
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,310
PROFESSOR 1: So we'll
see whether we

875
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,100
can do that, compress--

876
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,360
DANIELLE: Yes.

877
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,550
So I'll just call the first tour
and you guys can go down.

878
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,120
And obviously it's optional.

879
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,900
Don't feel-- if you're not
interested, you don't have to

880
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,310
go on the knock tour.

881
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,360
I think that's it.

882
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,550
PROFESSOR 1: Good.

883
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,615
Thank you.

884
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:56,265
[APPLAUSE]

885
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,070
PROFESSOR 1: We can talk
about a little bit.

886
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,720
So one thing.

887
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:07,060
We are trying to get HKN
feedback up to hopefully 90%,

888
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,990
and we are right now
at what, 11?

889
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,980
PROFESSOR 2: No, we're
a little bit higher.

890
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,910
We're now at about 16 or so.

891
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,550
PROFESSOR 1: 16.

892
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,150
So that's a little more way
to go from 16 to 90.

893
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,790
I hope you guys go back and
then fill out this survey.

894
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,310
Very important.

895
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,420
PROFESSOR 2: Please take a
few minutes to do that.

896
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,370
It really helps us in,
even if you want to

897
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,470
say bad things, OK?

898
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,100
It really helps overall to
give feedback and the

899
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,300
department likes to
see these things.

900
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,530
Oh yeah, thanks.

901
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,370
Likes to see how it
is that people are

902
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,530
responding to the courses.

903
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,320
So if you hated the course, if
you liked the course, in

904
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,640
particular, we have some
questions on there that are

905
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,650
specific to how we teach
the course next year.

906
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,890
One of the ideas we have for
next year is to introduce our

907
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,190
recitation sections,
which would focus

908
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,300
on the use of tools.

909
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,650
OK?

910
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,200
So basically the conceptual
stuff, much as we have the

911
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,710
lectures now, but then also
having something where it

912
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,400
really takes you through each
tool, and teaches how the use

913
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,040
of those tools which would
be taught once a week.

914
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,280
So if you think that's a good
idea, that's going to really

915
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,449
help to have that kind
of feedback.

916
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,120
And it will certainly help the
students who take it next year

917
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,150
if we can persuade the
department that that's worth

918
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,389
staffing the sections
next year.

919
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,340
Also if you have any positive
things to say about teaching

920
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,030
assistants, that's a great
place to put it.

921
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,320
OK?

922
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,949
If they helped you get through
this term, this is a great

923
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,760
place to say thank you and it
only takes a few minutes.

924
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,650
OK?

925
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,380
So I'm sure that some of the
TAs put in more than a few

926
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,969
minutes, OK, on your thing.

927
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,040
So to take a few minutes
and say thank you on

928
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,570
that form would be--

929
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,820
I'm sure they would very,
very much appreciate.

930
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,580
PROFESSOR 1: One thing, as
Charles mentioned, what we are

931
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,110
trying to do in recitation is do
a little bit of programmer

932
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,360
life skills.

933
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,810
So I know all of you guys are
probably very smart, can think

934
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,920
about the complex algorithms
and stuff like that.

935
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,040
But there are a lot of tools
that, it's not the smartness

936
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,090
but you can spend hours
trying to figure out.

937
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,280
But if you know it,
it will be useful.

938
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,930
So what we are trying to do is
have these recitations to say

939
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,010
OK, how to use a debugger.

940
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,800
And even how to change
a makefile.

941
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,130
Things like that.

942
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,760
So one thing, until the food
arrives, I'd like to say is,

943
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,560
get some feedback.

944
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,160
Think of what is a tool you'd
like to know or like to learn,

945
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,270
or something you think is very
useful for people coming next

946
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,110
year to learn.

947
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:42,310
That if you have spent a lot of
time worrying and you think

948
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,910
you spent way too much time
trying to understand, it would

949
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,220
be easier for us to
think about that.

950
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,950
I mean, I would like to
get your feedback.

951
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,150
And also some of you probably
will open up with some general

952
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,922
feedback on class.

953
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:56,820
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
you want to repeat that.

954
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,410
A more in depth thing
on how to use git

955
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,850
would be really useful.

956
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,040
Because I know it has things to
make your life easier, but

957
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,802
I don't know how to
use any of them.

958
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:08,830
AUDIENCE: Yeah. women are always
breaking the branches.

959
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,160
And it's like, yeah, we maybe
know how to do this and it is

960
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,790
really easy.

961
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,610
And then we're like, use
this git command.

962
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,434
And it's like, now your
branch is broken.

963
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:17,819
[LAUGHTER]

964
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:18,300
PROFESSOR 2: Good.

965
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,340
So git

966
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,710
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

967
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,480
I mean that's because those are
interesting tools because,

968
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,370
if you know everything
right, you can do

969
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,560
a lot of fun things.

970
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,690
But if you do it wrong, you end
up in huge mess that all

971
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,590
you do is scored all over the
place and you don't know.

972
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,330
So yes.

973
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,655
I mean I can relate to that.

974
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:36,927
AUDIENCE: If you use git
correctly, if you

975
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:39,000
know how to use git--

976
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,190
If you learn how to use git you
will find yourself using

977
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,250
it even when you're working
on a one person project.

978
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,400
git is awesome.

979
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,181
I can highly recommend
learning it.

980
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:51,950

981
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,920
AUDIENCE: What would be helpful
is that telling us

982
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,700
that you are running on an AMD
box and AMD doesn't support

983
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,905
SSE 4.1 instructions.

984
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:03,090
[LAUGHTER]

985
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,140
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, I mean, this
is supposed to be X86

986
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,440
compatible, all those things.

987
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,860
But I mean, some people learn
the hard way that, OK, the

988
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,760
word is not the same
even though--

989
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,830
PROFESSOR 2: But that is part
of the lesson of the course,

990
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,090
is how do you make high
performance portable?

991
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,450
OK?

992
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:25,080
And so what you choose or
don't choose to use is--

993
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,140
But I agree.

994
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,990
PROFESSOR 1: That's why we ran,
we want to run it the

995
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,510
night before because we knew
things like this would happen.

996
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,300
So we can at least give some
time to say OK, look.

997
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,975
Go change something.

998
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:37,930
Were you able to fix that?

999
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:38,500
OK.

1000
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,340
Good.

1001
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,766
So yes.

1002
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:41,520
PROFESSOR 2: Good.

1003
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,320
PROFESSOR 1: And sometimes the
problem is, a lot of these

1004
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,595
small changes you don't know
until you run into things like

1005
00:37:47,595 --> 00:37:52,100
this and oh, somewhere in page
256 in the manual that there's

1006
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,550
a footnote say, oh,
by the way.

1007
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,880
And that's what happens
in there.

1008
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,650
I mean if you had listed
everything that would be

1009
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,150
probably and entire encyclopedia
of things that

1010
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,300
you will see.

1011
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,780
PROFESSOR 2: So one other thing
that people ask about

1012
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,050
is, what comes after
this course?

1013
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,010
OK?

1014
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,510
So next term Saman is teaching
the compiler course.

1015
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,005
PROFESSOR 1: It's Martin.

1016
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:16,200
PROFESSOR 2: Are you
teaching with him?

1017
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,495
PROFESSOR 1: No.

1018
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:17,475
PROFESSOR 2: Oh, you're
not teaching.

1019
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:17,770
OK.

1020
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,110
I thought you were.

1021
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,810
OK.

1022
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,690
So in any case, compiler
course is a

1023
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,550
good follow-on course.

1024
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,210
For those who haven't done
6.046, that's a good course

1025
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,180
and I'll be teaching that
course next term.

1026
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,040
In addition, how many people
here have done a UROP?

1027
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,890

1028
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,710
Few of you.

1029
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,790
So let me encourage you
to look for UROPs.

1030
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,730
You now have some skills that
will make you really valuable.

1031
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,370
And in particular my group
is looking for--

1032
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,710
[LAUGHTER]

1033
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,070
PROFESSOR 2: Probably two more
UROPs than I have already.

1034
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,390
Already Boone is one of my
UROPs, started just a

1035
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,070
couple weeks ago.

1036
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,360
And so we do have some other
projects in both architecture

1037
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,070
and in software-related things.

1038
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,920
And so.

1039
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,540
if you're interested, you go
to my group's web page.

1040
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,560
It tells you five things you
have to submit if you want to

1041
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,660
work in my group.

1042
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:10,950
OK?

1043
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,880
That includes things like
samples of your code.

1044
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,580
Well, you ought to
have that by now.

1045
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,250
And so forth.

1046
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,090
So let me encourage
you to do that.

1047
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:23,330
And Saman also has active
participation of

1048
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,670
UROPs in his group.

1049
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:24,950
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

1050
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,860
So my employees already
started doing a

1051
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,790
project in my group.

1052
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,890
And I'm also looking for a
couple more people to do some

1053
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,950
compiler, runtime system, and
a bunch of high performance

1054
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,980
type projects I have.

1055
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,490
And also for future course,
one course I want to also

1056
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,670
mention is this IAP.

1057
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,320
There's a course that is done
with collaboration with VMware

1058
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,550
to look at how to build scalable
large systems using

1059
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,480
this the Spring and
Java platforms.

1060
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,650
So if they're interested in
trying to see how things were

1061
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,040
running on one machine and run
something that can scale up to

1062
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,050
hundreds of machines.

1063
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,490
If you have ideas of creating
an I 8 with web 2.0,

1064
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,330
interesting thing.

1065
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,930
Here is an opportunity
to do that.

1066
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,590
So if you're looking
for interesting IAP

1067
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,630
courses, this is great.

1068
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,830
PROFESSOR 2: I really encourage
every single person

1069
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:23,580
who completed this class
to do a UROP with

1070
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,430
somebody before you leave.

1071
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,550
It's really a way of integrating
your knowledge.

1072
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:32,050
And it is one of the most
valuable experiences that you

1073
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:36,390
can have at MIT is to do a UROP
for a professor and get

1074
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,680
involved in the research
of a group.

1075
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,210
Because in some ways it's like
this course, in that it

1076
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,470
integrates knowledge from a
lot of different sources.

1077
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,140
And it isn't just one thing.

1078
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,890
But even more than
this course.

1079
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,070
This course we still
are dealing

1080
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,320
with artificial things.

1081
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,040
And in the researcher
arena, you're

1082
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,870
dealing with real problems.

1083
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,900
So let me just once again
encourage you to spend some

1084
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:07,160
time getting a UROP and
certainly looking

1085
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,030
for AUPs and MEng.

1086
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,400
How many people here are
looking at MEng as a

1087
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,982
possibility?

1088
00:41:14,982 --> 00:41:16,670
So a fair number.

1089
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah, that's good.

1090
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,530
That's great.

1091
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,760
PROFESSOR 1: I want
to add to that.

1092
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,730
So these days there has been a
big philosophical discussion

1093
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,080
saying why do you have
to have universities?

1094
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,000
You go to OCW and sit home in
your bedroom and you can

1095
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,930
follow all these courses,
and you don't have to

1096
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,040
pay a mighty tuition.

1097
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,460
And wouldn't that
be good enough?

1098
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,390
One part that's not good
enough is this class.

1099
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,230
So I mean think about it.

1100
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,960
I mean you can't go get the OCW
catalog and have this kind

1101
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,970
of a dynamic.

1102
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,220
There's no seventh floor.

1103
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,390

1104
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,810
All in OCW.

1105
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,430
And you have from there to
go and get motivated.

1106
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,980
So that's one part of that.

1107
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:03,080
PROFESSOR 2: There's no John
or Reed or Eric or Josh to

1108
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,990
respond quickly about
what's going on.

1109
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,640
PROFESSOR 1: That's one.

1110
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,280
But I think one other thing that
a lot of people miss when

1111
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,740
they look at all of the
curriculum and stuff like that

1112
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,090
is the UROP ability.

1113
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:19,890
So a lot of these people, that
is something, it's very unique

1114
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,080
to MIT and a lot of people
benefit hugely with UROPs.

1115
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,560
I have had UROPs who started
with me as seniors.

1116
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,040
By the time they are graduating
with their MEng

1117
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,480
they have two first out
papers in the best

1118
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,700
conference out there.

1119
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,030
And everybody thinks, when they
say they are looking for

1120
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,000
a job, they are finishing their
Ph.D and looking for

1121
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,560
academic jobs.

1122
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:38,730
No.

1123
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,700
They are just finishing
up their masters.

1124
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,270
And I have a couple of students
that managed to

1125
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,870
become really expert in an
area by being a UROP.

1126
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:50,120
So they are finishing up at MIT
as a generalist, saying

1127
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,990
give me a job.

1128
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,770
But you're finishing up
and have some deep

1129
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,750
knowledge in some area.

1130
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,880
Sitting in and at the same level
as most Ph.Ds or most

1131
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,800
really deep practicing engineers
in that area.

1132
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,980
So that level, even if you don't
do that, just seeing

1133
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,900
what happens in a research
group, being

1134
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,540
participating on that.

1135
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,980
Pushing, seeing something
to the maximum limit.

1136
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,950
I mean in the class,
that's a limit.

1137
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,670
I mean even though this class is
somewhat open, says make it

1138
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,200
run as fast as possible.

1139
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,830
But most of the time in the
class, it's like, we give you

1140
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,650
something, if you made that,
OK, you're done with it.

1141
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,530
In research, there's no limit.

1142
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,175
You really, really push
your boundaries.

1143
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,130
What's that?

1144
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,600
PROFESSOR 2: So what do
we have here, John?

1145
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,620
JOHN: I counted in my mailbox
how many messages came from

1146
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,580
6.172 staff, and it's
about 3,500 over the

1147
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,960
course of this term.

1148
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,692
PROFESSOR 2: Wow.

1149
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:49,460
[APPLAUSE]

1150
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,555
PROFESSOR 1: How much time--

1151
00:43:50,555 --> 00:43:53,350
PROFESSOR 2: So, this is also,
as Saman mentions, a

1152
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,100
programmer life skills course.

1153
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,810
And one of the things that you
should get used to in life is

1154
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,760
thanking people who help you.

1155
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,110
OK?

1156
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,770
I think that all of the MIT
POSSE members, all the people

1157
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:11,530
who devoted, volunteered their
time to help you, could really

1158
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:17,350
appreciate an email that says
thank you and what exactly you

1159
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,960
feel you learned from them.

1160
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,500
OK?

1161
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,250
Because it's one thing
to just say

1162
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,500
thanks, so long, et cetera.

1163
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,270
In addition, these people are
contacts, part of your network

1164
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,125
of understanding what the world
of software developers

1165
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:38,490
is all about, and can serve as
useful contacts to keep.

1166
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,620
How many people use a service
like LinkedIn

1167
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,580
or something to--

1168
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,280
You probably all you mostly
use Facebook.

1169
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,410
Anybody use LinkedIn
at this point?

1170
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,180
So many professionals use--

1171
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,380
I don't want to pitch for
LinkedIn, but it is one of the

1172
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,470
services that lots
of people are on.

1173
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:56,990
So what are some of the other
services that people use for

1174
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,210
professional contacts?

1175
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,524
AUDIENCE: The only thing
people try to

1176
00:44:59,524 --> 00:45:00,840
contact me on is LinkedIn.

1177
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,590
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah.

1178
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,870
So, good idea to start
connecting and building a

1179
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,770
network of people who you
know and who can answer

1180
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,280
questions for you.

1181
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:10,660
OK?

1182
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,410
Such as, gee, I'm considering
these two kinds of job offers.

1183
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,470
What should I be looking for?

1184
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,660
It might be good to get a
professional software

1185
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,350
engineer's input to that.

1186
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:18,580
OK?

1187
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,460
Because you know these folks.

1188
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,150
You've had a few meetings
with them.

1189
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:21,480
OK?

1190
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,380
And they know you.

1191
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,150
And they may be able to say
here's my take on that, as

1192
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,920
well as getting input from your
family and your friends

1193
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,710
and your professors and other
people that you know.

1194
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:42,170
But I do think that courtesy
goes a long way in life.

1195
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,930
And they really have, these are
all people, as I say, who

1196
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,620
spent time looking
over your code.

1197
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,530
And you should have heard some
of the comments we got from

1198
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,790
them after project one.

1199
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,830
Oh my God, they have a single
letter variable names for the

1200
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:54,590
whole thing.

1201
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,510
Or, what are you teaching
these students?

1202
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,450
And I said no, this is exactly
why we want you there.

1203
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,380
OK?

1204
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,350
So I think that if you feel in
particular, whether or not you

1205
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,110
feel you got anything
out of it, OK?

1206
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,550
But in particular, if you did
get something out of it, it

1207
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,100
would be really good idea to not
forget to send some email

1208
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,330
off to thank them.

1209
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,394

1210
00:46:19,394 --> 00:46:22,030
PROFESSOR 1: OK, we want to get
some feedback from them.

1211
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,470
PROFESSOR 2: Sure.

1212
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,130
PROFESSOR 1: Have open mic?

1213
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:23,660
PROFESSOR 2: Open mic?

1214
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,970
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

1215
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,860
PROFESSOR 2: Actually, open mic,
let's do it like this.

1216
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,400
Because I think it'll be easier
and better for the

1217
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,190
video if we just have
people come up and--

1218
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,435
PROFESSOR 1: I don't know that
they're going to be too

1219
00:46:35,435 --> 00:46:35,590
intimidating.

1220
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,290
PROFESSOR 2: That's OK.

1221
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,070
They can handle it.

1222
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,370
These are seasoned--

1223
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:44,130

1224
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,790
So, comments about the class.

1225
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,315
PROFESSOR 1: How
we can improve?

1226
00:46:48,315 --> 00:46:49,460
We'd really like to hear that.

1227
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,720
I mean things you liked
and didn't like.

1228
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,620
For example, these absolute
gradings we did for projects

1229
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:02,300
had passionate support and
control let's say before.

1230
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,370
I mean, did you guys feel giving
the top marke for the

1231
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:08,400
fastest and having at least a
log scale, no, we didn't do a

1232
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,790
linear scale going down.

1233
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,540
I mean, hey.

1234
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,270
Was it motivating
or demotivating?

1235
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,900

1236
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,750
PROFESSOR 2: So what do people
think was the most valuable

1237
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,510
thing out of the course?

1238
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,610
I've had dinner with a few
of you, and you were very

1239
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,470
opinionated over dinner.

1240
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,480
So I don't mind hearing those
comments again, but making

1241
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,360
them for other people.

1242
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,680
So I know it's intimidating,
but what I want

1243
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,520
to do is get a line.

1244
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,360
As one person's talking
I want other

1245
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,400
people to line up behind.

1246
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,420
And just give us
some feedback.

1247
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,260
PROFESSOR 1: Come on.

1248
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,740
PROFESSOR 2: OK, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

1249
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,270
Who's brave?

1250
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.

1251
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,130
You got halfway of your seat.

1252
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:47,560
Yeah.

1253
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,330
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, come on.

1254
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,350
PROFESSOR 2: I'm sure
you have an opinion.

1255
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,235
Who here does not
have an opinion?

1256
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:51,700
PROFESSOR 1: Sure.

1257
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,630
Yeah.

1258
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,030
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah, yeah, good.

1259
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,820
And then you can
line up right--

1260
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,590
there you go.

1261
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,150
OK?

1262
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,350
There you go.

1263
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:04,580
And then others can come up
behind as they're motivated.

1264
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,550
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

1265
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,240
First of all, I'd like to thank
the professors and the

1266
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,320
TAs for this opportunity.

1267
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,310
This is absolutely wonderful.

1268
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,460
And all the students
I worked with.

1269
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,710
You were all great.

1270
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,040

1271
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,780
I just wanted to say when you
were talking about what the

1272
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,030
most valuable thing in the class
people thought was, I

1273
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,290
don't even know how to pick.

1274
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:30,530
Of the projects that we worked
on, or that they worked on, I

1275
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,440
looked at every one and just
thought, what of the content

1276
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,700
of this project have I used
just in the past year?

1277
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,230
And the amount of stuff that
I've made significant use of

1278
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:47,500
that you guys covered has been
at least 75%, maybe even more,

1279
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,100
of the material of the class.

1280
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,210
And that means that if you look
over multiple engineers,

1281
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,580
you probably pretty quickly get
coverage of 100% of it.

1282
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,750
All these projects, profiling,
parallelism, algorithms, bit

1283
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,640
hacks, these are all things
that I use on.

1284
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,033
if not a daily basis,
then a weekly basis.

1285
00:49:07,033 --> 00:49:07,920
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

1286
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,330
Good.

1287
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:09,827
Thanks.

1288
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:10,821
Thank you.

1289
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:13,810
[APPLAUSE]

1290
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:16,370
AUDIENCE: So for me, like, I
really had no experience with

1291
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,130
C or C++ or really distributed
version

1292
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,770
control before this class.

1293
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,440
So a lot of my time I think was
spent kind of learning the

1294
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,210
basics of that.

1295
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,800
I spent a lot of time initially
learning the basics

1296
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,280
like pointer arithmetic and
that kind of stuff.

1297
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,330
And then a lot of time learning
the profiling tools.

1298
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,860
So I wish, I really do wish more
time was spent kind of--

1299
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,170
well, your recitation, I think,
would be a good way to

1300
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,810
really get that out
of the way.

1301
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,300
Because the algorithmic stuff
was more easy for me, which I

1302
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,245
thought was kind of ridiculous.

1303
00:49:43,245 --> 00:49:44,190
You know?

1304
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,660
[LAUGHTER]

1305
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,250
AUDIENCE: The fact that these
tools are what's holding back,

1306
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,050
that I have to spend a
lot of time learning.

1307
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,000
PROFESSOR 1: This is actually
something very interesting

1308
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,200
people have observed.

1309
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,720
So if you do physics problems
or math problems, if you run

1310
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,550
into an issue, after a certain
amount of time you will just

1311
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,090
go ask somebody.

1312
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:08,500
But in programming, people seem
to go on and on and on

1313
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,760
trying to debug this
simple thing.

1314
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,830
And part of that, part of what
we try to get is also not just

1315
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,930
all the cool algorithms
and stuff like that.

1316
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,490
To give you a process.

1317
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,480
Because there are times when you
start saying this program

1318
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,940
is slow, what you do?

1319
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,130
And I think that's a missing
part sometimes about the

1320
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,690
process of debugging.

1321
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,980
If the program doesn't
work, what do you do?

1322
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,870
Where do you start?

1323
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,680
I think that's why we are trying
to do a little bit of,

1324
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,670
basically, these life skills.

1325
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,760
AUDIENCE: It was great to
learn but it was more

1326
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,150
stressful to learn.

1327
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,630
I'm not as willing to ask as a
lot of people, so it's hard

1328
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:44,440
for me to--

1329
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,750
PROFESSOR 1: So one thing we're

1330
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,650
trying to do is probably--

1331
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,530
PROFESSOR 2: That's
great feedback.

1332
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:51,130
PROFESSOR 2: We will try to
formalize next year the

1333
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,160
seventh floor lounge, because
a lot of people

1334
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,520
who came there benefited.

1335
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,940
But have it a little bit more.

1336
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,610
And also get a little bit
more life skills type

1337
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,470
things early on.

1338
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,330
Like if you find a problem,
what will happen?

1339
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,770
AUDIENCE: It could be a
lot longer than that.

1340
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,250
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

1341
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,220
PROFESSOR 2: Yes, so that's
our goal, is to make it so

1342
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,880
that people come up to
speed more quickly.

1343
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,260
But in some sense, another goal
but I have here, next

1344
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,760
year, is that the C students
will stay in the class.

1345
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,050
OK?

1346
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,810
So what happened is most of the
C students dropped out.

1347
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,900
So in case you want to know,
most people are going to get

1348
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,210
A's and B's.

1349
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,130
OK?

1350
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,810
So most of the C students
dropped out.

1351
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:30,270
And I would like to have people
complete the course,

1352
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:33,680
even the C students, feeling
that it's useful to complete

1353
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,930
the course.

1354
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,760

1355
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,320
AUDIENCE: So I think again,
as the person before me, I

1356
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,980
learned a lot.

1357
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,990
I hadn't had almost any
experience in C or

1358
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,620
C++ before the class.

1359
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,700
I had some experience
with git.

1360
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,060
But I think that the class
has a lot to offer.

1361
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,720
There's a lot of content
covered.

1362
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,220
And I wish that, for example,
there are things that I wish

1363
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,160
that I could have learned more
about, how to implement in a

1364
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,260
formal way.

1365
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,990
Things like SSE instructions.

1366
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,265
So I feel that like there was a
clear cut off of people who

1367
00:52:05,265 --> 00:52:07,880
had a lot of experience and they
could be like, OK, I know

1368
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,420
how to do assembly, I know how
to do other things, and if I

1369
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,280
want to optimize this function
I can, whatever.

1370
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,190
Write it down.

1371
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:17,180
And then there's these other
people that don't have that

1372
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,066
much experience that in a class
it mentions this is how

1373
00:52:21,066 --> 00:52:23,850
you use SSE or compiler
optimizations.

1374
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,870
It's kind of mentioned but
not really more in depth.

1375
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,190
This is a case of how do you
actually do this in real life?

1376
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,950
I mean, I think maybe the
examples given in class were

1377
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,410
useful but very superfluous.

1378
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,340
Like you don't really know.

1379
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,470
I know that I was looking
through other projects that

1380
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,750
were similar to ours
for the final.

1381
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,810
And I think it's a class
that you taught in IAP.

1382
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,960
There was a team of people that
did a ray tracer in the

1383
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,010
multi-programming.

1384
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,630
And they used SSE and
CMD everywhere.

1385
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,090
They packaged everything.

1386
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,670
But that's something that I
said, it'll be really awesome

1387
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,510
to do, but I have no idea
how to start doing it.

1388
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,940
And I think that there's still
a lot of room to actually

1389
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,660
apply the concepts that are
trying to be taught.

1390
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,710
PROFESSOR 2: I think it's our
intention actually to increase

1391
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,235
that part of the course,
the data

1392
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:12,030
parallel part of the course.

1393
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,690
Which I think we'll
be able to do.

1394
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,000
One of our concerns about adding
material has been, OK,

1395
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,500
that means you guys have
to learn it too.

1396
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,340

1397
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,720
But I think that if we're able
to reduce the workload of the

1398
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,430
learning of the tools by having
recitations, we then

1399
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:36,420
can look at adding other
material, and expect that the

1400
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,270
load on students won't go up.

1401
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,480
AUDIENCE: Right.

1402
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,870
I mean even what
I want to say.

1403
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,510
It's not even adding material,
what I think.

1404
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,080
I feel that I was going to
class, learning all of these

1405
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,670
cool things.

1406
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,950
And then I was looking at my
project and it's like well,

1407
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:50,610
these are the things that
I know how to do.

1408
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,610
And I know that they
mentioned all these

1409
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,580
other things in class.

1410
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:56,980
I don't know how to make
them in my project.

1411
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,720
PROFESSOR 2: Great comment.

1412
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,130
PROFESSOR 1: So I think one
thing both good and bad about

1413
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:04,340
this class is what
happened in--

1414
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,550
I think it applied
to all of you.

1415
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,810
When you try to teach computer
science, you get people who

1416
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,450
are for the first time they are
writing any piece of code

1417
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,120
more than 20 lines.

1418
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,170
And you get people who are
checking in code for Apache.

1419
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,660
And you have that entire range
of people in the class.

1420
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,440
So how do you teach everybody?

1421
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,500
And a lot of times when you give
a fixed project, either

1422
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,290
somebody's completely struggling
to finish that, or

1423
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,360
they are like in
a day is done.

1424
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,510
They are like, so what's this?

1425
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,150
What's new?

1426
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,150
The thing about performance
is, asked lot of people,

1427
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,830
figured out there's
no end to it.

1428
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,820
And you can keep doing
it, you can do more,

1429
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,120
you can do more deeper.

1430
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,440
So the nice thing about--

1431
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,580
one thing about this class is
that there's something for

1432
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,080
everybody in that.

1433
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,715
So if you are struggling still,
if you're learning, you

1434
00:54:47,715 --> 00:54:49,540
can still get to someplace,
learn a lot.

1435
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,420
But if you have done that when
you are in the fourth grade,

1436
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,540
you can still go and do
something more, push that.

1437
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,140
So we try to keep that
balance in there.

1438
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,450
So we don't want to
bore anybody.

1439
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,860
And also we don't want a lot of
people dropping out of the

1440
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,470
class either.

1441
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,650
AUDIENCE: So continuing on with
what other people said, I

1442
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,750
also ran into the same
problems with that.

1443
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,440
Just the syntax,
just the tools.

1444
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,140
So I guess I'll start off
thanking John and Reed,

1445
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,330
they're really fast and good
at what they're doing.

1446
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,070
And I feel like I've asked a
lot of dumb questions, and

1447
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:23,488
they're good at answering
those.

1448
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:26,356
[APPLAUSE]

1449
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,560
PROFESSOR 2: So John and
Reed and Josh all took

1450
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,500
the class last year.

1451
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:32,910
OK?

1452
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:36,040
And it's amazing, if you
ask John how he did

1453
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,619
on the final project--

1454
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:40,890
[LAUGHTER]

1455
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,380
PROFESSOR 2: He didn't
do so well.

1456
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,580
OK?

1457
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,780
But it's amazing.

1458
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,260
You'll discover, it's amazing
what you guys are going to

1459
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,440
learn next semester after
being out of the class.

1460
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,400
Because you're on a path to
learning this stuff for

1461
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,800
yourself now.

1462
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,080
OK?

1463
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,280
And you'll find that in all
kinds of things you do that

1464
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,730
all these skills, you can
keep building them.

1465
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,530
We will definitely be looking
for TAs next fall.

1466
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:05,910
And so people who are
interested should--

1467
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,710
who are going to be
MENGs should--

1468
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,840
and even if you're
undergraduate, you're still

1469
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,070
allowed to work hourly
for the class.

1470
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,530
In fact, that's what
John is doing.

1471
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,990
So if you're interested,
please let us know.

1472
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,010
Please let us know.

1473
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:29,230
PROFESSOR 1: So you can have
this nice experience as a TA.

1474
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:32,010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so, and then I
want to say something that I

1475
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,770
really love about this course.

1476
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,410
I feel like it's such an
integrated experience.

1477
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:42,340
It's, maybe except project one,
everything after that is,

1478
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,450
you get a piece of code, as you
would normally, and then

1479
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,410
everything is within
your bounds of--

1480
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:49,980
you can do anything
that you want.

1481
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,270
So I really like how it's not
limited to like, oh, we're on

1482
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:57,040
this topic so we're going to
write a little algorithm that

1483
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,090
implements this particular
algorithm, and then move on to

1484
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,560
next unit, and then nothing
ever comes together.

1485
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,780
So that's something I really
love about this course.

1486
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:12,210
And the next thing I want to
say is the beta grading.

1487
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,900
For project three, I was working
with Angela, I feel

1488
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:21,510
like from beta to final, because
I don't have much

1489
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:27,670
experience with C, so it takes
me so long to just get the

1490
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,830
syntax right, to get
my own going.

1491
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,580
So for beta, we didn't have
anything working.

1492
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,780
It doesn't even build.

1493
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,240
But with two or three more
hours, we got it working.

1494
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,190
It's not super fast, but
we kept working on it.

1495
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:44,290
And by the final we have
something I felt pretty proud.

1496
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,160
But the beta grading doesn't
take that into account.

1497
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,590
Like if you are not very
experienced with C, it takes

1498
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:53,890
you a long time, longer than
other people have experienced

1499
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,700
to get something going
in the first place.

1500
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,290
But beta kind of penalizes you
for just not having enough

1501
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:00,710
time to do things you want.

1502
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,060
PROFESSOR 1: I think it's
a double-edged sword.

1503
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:08,440
Because if you don't do beta,
then you have very harsh.

1504
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,240
You have one time code,
it's in and out.

1505
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,680
If you just really don't do,
give that much grading for

1506
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,790
beta and make it optional
and stuff like that,

1507
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:17,550
people just drop beta.

1508
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,100
They don't just do
anything in it.

1509
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,570
So we try to do something, give
everybody a true chance

1510
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,562
and get everybody a real
motivation to actually work

1511
00:58:24,562 --> 00:58:25,250
for both sides.

1512
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,840
Because for a lot of you
guys, beta defined and

1513
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,910
you learned a lot.

1514
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,560
Because you got something
in beta.

1515
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,150
And for most of the classes I
have, we had things called

1516
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,450
checkpoints.

1517
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,810
For example, compiler class, you
had to do a checkpoint and

1518
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,800
checkpoint will be used more
like subjectivity to grade.

1519
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,510
We don't say how many grade
percent checkpoint.

1520
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:47,630
But if checkpoint has nothing,
then we'll be very harsh

1521
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,495
grading later.

1522
00:58:48,495 --> 00:58:49,490
We always provide that.

1523
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,960
But still, people don't take
checkpoint that seriously.

1524
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,140
But here we have to try to make
something to make people

1525
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,210
get beta seriously, do something
there, and then give

1526
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,350
them the opportunity
to improve.

1527
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,490
I think there's a balance
in that somewhere.

1528
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,513
PROFESSOR 2: And I wouldn't
worry about your grade.

1529
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:05,080
[LAUGHTER]

1530
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,850
AUDIENCE: Maybe like one idea
I was thinking is maybe

1531
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,660
there's some component
of improvement

1532
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,490
from beta to final.

1533
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,680
Like the proportional
improvement that you made from

1534
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:13,950
beta to final.

1535
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,020
PROFESSOR 2: Oh, that's
a good idea, actually.

1536
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:15,835
That's a good idea.

1537
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,920
Yeah, to say, if you made a--

1538
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,650
Although you want to be
careful about people

1539
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:20,270
sandbagging.

1540
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,566
[LAUGHTER]

1541
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:22,430
PROFESSOR 1: Exactly.

1542
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,840
AUDIENCE: And then one
last small thing--

1543
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,080
PROFESSOR 2: I want to make
sure we get to everybody.

1544
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,350
AUDIENCE: OK, sorry.

1545
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,765
PROFESSOR 2: So if you
want to go around to

1546
00:59:26,765 --> 00:59:28,390
the end of the line.

1547
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,410
AUDIENCE: That's actually
mostly all of it.

1548
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:30,770
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

1549
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,340
Thank you.

1550
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,130
AUDIENCE: So I've said some of
this on my evaluation, which I

1551
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:35,690
already turned in.

1552
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,560
But I'll repeat it for
everyone else.

1553
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,990
[APPLAUSE]

1554
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:40,590
AUDIENCE: A couple things.

1555
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,170
One relating to the grading
which you mentioned.

1556
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,790
Honestly, I found it incredibly
stressful knowing

1557
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,170
that it was competitive
grading.

1558
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,490
Because we had no idea where
the benchmark was.

1559
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,290
So it's like, well we've
improved it.

1560
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,400
But did we improve it enough?

1561
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,670
Did everyone else not improve
it any more than we did?

1562
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:00,140
And it was just like having it
be a complete unknown was

1563
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:00,840
pretty stressful.

1564
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,300
So I don't know if there's some
way you could do like a--

1565
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,450
like maybe the TAs got some
speed up, and that's the

1566
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:10,260
benchmark to start with
or something.

1567
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,390
PROFESSOR 1: I guess what we did
this time is basically we

1568
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,050
gave the best grade as a
benchmark for the final.

1569
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:19,960
And if you go above that, it's
just bragging rights.

1570
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,699
AUDIENCE: I mean, when you're
working on the beta, you have

1571
01:00:21,699 --> 01:00:22,990
no idea what's going on.

1572
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:24,590
But I did like that.

1573
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,338
Once you know where the
benchmark is, then it's nice

1574
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:28,000
to know what you're
aiming for.

1575
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,530
PROFESSOR 1: So the thing about
that is, the flip side

1576
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,940
of that is, we don't want
somebody that a lot of courses

1577
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,770
they say OK, I'm done.

1578
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:36,000
When you go there something, Oh
yeah, I met the thing, OK,

1579
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,010
I'm getting a good grade,
OK, I move on.

1580
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,990
I mean, we want people kind of
to keep pushing in time.

1581
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:43,260
Because sometimes
the thing is--

1582
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,620
If I have a minute, I'll
tell the story.

1583
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,570
There's this guy named Tony
Danzig who basically invented

1584
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,690
the simplex method.

1585
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,210
His thing was, he was always
late to class.

1586
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,180
He went to class one
day and there was--

1587
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,420
normally the professor writes
the problems on the board.

1588
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,010
So he copied the problems
down and went home.

1589
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,360
And they were really
hard problems.

1590
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,200
And so he was like, damn.

1591
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,080
I don't know how
to solve this.

1592
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,260
And he worked very hard
and solved it.

1593
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,310
And wrote a note to the
professor saying I'm sorry

1594
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,440
this is late, and put
it on his desk.

1595
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,645
And a couple of hours later he
gets this excited professor

1596
01:01:13,645 --> 01:01:15,090
running around trying
to find him.

1597
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:17,940
Because what the professor had
done is written two unsolved

1598
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,190
problems on the board.

1599
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:21,450

1600
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:23,890
He came late to the class, he
didn't know that, he had two

1601
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,010
problems, he copied them down.

1602
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,904
He worked very hard
and solved it.

1603
01:01:26,904 --> 01:01:27,670
[LAUGHTER]

1604
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:29,730
PROFESSOR 1: And so the
professor said divide this up,

1605
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:30,640
you get your pay at the end.

1606
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,680
Then there's lots of it.

1607
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,850
So this is something
like that.

1608
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:36,160
If you give the thing, if you
know where we are going, for

1609
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,100
some people it will
be a hard climb.

1610
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,102
But other people, they will get
there faster, they'll say

1611
01:01:40,102 --> 01:01:40,820
OK, I'm done.

1612
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,530
And what we want to do is give
them the ability to kind of

1613
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,130
really push to their limits,
not some artificial limit.

1614
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,270
But not to penalize
too much for that.

1615
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,630
We try to balance this out.

1616
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,990
So I want everybody to go
to their best limits.

1617
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:54,790
AUDIENCE: I had one other
thing to say.

1618
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:57,490
Have you considered or would
it be possible to make the

1619
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,540
class more than a 12
credit course?

1620
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,030
[LAUGHTER]

1621
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:01,610
AUDIENCE: No, seriously.

1622
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,280
Since there is so much material
and we keep talking

1623
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,390
about wouldn't it be nice to
add this and add that.

1624
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,550
But I don't know about you, but
I spend a lot of time in

1625
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,600
this course already.

1626
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,320
And I mean, I think it's the
kind of class where you could

1627
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,190
pack 16 or 18 credits worth
of material into it.

1628
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,360
PROFESSOR 2: More realistic
would be to have a follow-on.

1629
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,720
PROFESSOR 1: Try to make
it as two classes.

1630
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,980
PROFESSOR 2: To make a
two-semester sequence.

1631
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:30,710
But I think Saman and I still
feel that this, it's like, OK,

1632
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:32,810
that's a new development
effort.

1633
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:33,780
That this class still--

1634
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,550
I think we feel that there's
more than incremental

1635
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:38,770
improvement we can do to make
the class teachable.

1636
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,240
For example, by introducing
recitations.

1637
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,290
And so I think once--

1638
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:50,160
maybe after next semester,
next fall we can we can--

1639
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,280
But thank you, because I think
that that would be good.

1640
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,010
And the whole idea of the
sections is to try

1641
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,540
to reduce your load.

1642
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,550
There used to be a thing that
was on all the evaluations

1643
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,080
that they no longer do.

1644
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,930
And this is actually before
I got to MIT.

1645
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:08,880
They had a measure called
cums per tooling hour.

1646
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,220
OK?

1647
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:15,040
So a cum is how many units of
knowledge you're using in

1648
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,650
whatever measure, and tooling
hours, like how hard you work.

1649
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,870
And they got rid of it because
they said it was not

1650
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:24,370
quantitative.

1651
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,580
After all, what's a cum?

1652
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:26,870
All right.

1653
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:30,520
Well, regardless of the fact
they got rid of that, because

1654
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,140
I think that it actually was a
very useful measure, even if

1655
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,910
people are subjective
about it.

1656
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,820
That's our goal in the course.

1657
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,120
It's not to make people spend
a lot of time and then have

1658
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,920
learned epsilon.

1659
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,540
It's to have them, for the time
they put in, learn as

1660
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,940
much as possible.

1661
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,480
And so I think that we recognize
it's a lot more work

1662
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,070
right now that you folks
are going through.

1663
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,480
We hope that it's
rewarding work.

1664
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,400
But we hope we can do even
better in terms of giving

1665
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,520
people the opportunity to
learn these things.

1666
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,740
PROFESSOR 1: So we are thinking
about cutting things.

1667
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,530
We all are thinking about
what to eliminate

1668
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:03,790
even if we add something.

1669
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,680
It's very hard because we
think a lot things are

1670
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,250
useful-- important.

1671
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,510
But something has to give.

1672
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:09,580
So that's the hard decision.

1673
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,950
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah, we're
thinking of cutting caching

1674
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,546
and parallelism.

1675
01:04:12,546 --> 01:04:16,830
[LAUGHTER]

1676
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,360
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

1677
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:18,630
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

1678
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,300
We have to hurry because we
gotta be out of the room by 4.

1679
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,865
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to say that I agree.

1680
01:04:22,865 --> 01:04:24,970
That I didn't really like the
way the course was graded.

1681
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,540
But I did like the material
in the course a lot.

1682
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,950
So that was good.

1683
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:30,560
But for one thing, the thing
about the competitive grading

1684
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,860
was that it was way more
stressful than necessary.

1685
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,660
My luck was good because
we had the kind

1686
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,350
of benchmark thing.

1687
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:41,330
It was a reasonable high
performance to attain.

1688
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:45,650
And also I didn't like
the way some of

1689
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:46,780
the stuff was weighted.

1690
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,900
For example, it didn't really
correspond to how much time I

1691
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,960
spent on it.

1692
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,360
The pset was worth like 3% or
4% of the grade and it took

1693
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,970
like hours, I think.

1694
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:56,220
Many, many hours.

1695
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,800

1696
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,630
That's all.

1697
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,744
PROFESSOR 1: OK, thank you.

1698
01:05:00,744 --> 01:05:02,512
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

1699
01:05:02,512 --> 01:05:06,340
AUDIENCE: There is one thing
that's pretty general about

1700
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,790
course six, I guess,
is that they're

1701
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,190
really lenient on prereqs.

1702
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:12,555
Since I've only been at MIT
for like three months.

1703
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:12,820
[LAUGHTER]

1704
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,270
AUDIENCE: So yes,
I'm a freshman.

1705
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:16,460
PROFESSOR 1: One freshman
in the class.

1706
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,205
There you go.

1707
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:20,960
AUDIENCE: I'm really thankful
that Professor Leiserson and

1708
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,670
Professor Amarasinghe
let me into the

1709
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,540
course without any prereqs.

1710
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,610
And I like the breadth
of the topics.

1711
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:32,600
But I think with office hours
we could have gotten a bit

1712
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,090
deeper into them.

1713
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:38,050
And one suggestion I'd like to
make is that get the nightly

1714
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,300
builds working.

1715
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,400

1716
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,161
It was there for one night for
project one, and that was it.

1717
01:05:46,161 --> 01:05:49,570
[LAUGHTER]

1718
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,840
AUDIENCE: So I decided
this is my last--

1719
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,080
PROFESSOR 2: Can you
talk in the mic?

1720
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,550
AUDIENCE: So this is my
last term at MIT.

1721
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:58,600
And I decided to take things
easy by not taking that many

1722
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,729
courses and TAing this course.

1723
01:06:01,729 --> 01:06:07,600
[LAUGHTER]

1724
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,230
AUDIENCE: So yeah.

1725
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,183
It would be nice to have
48 unit TA shifts too.

1726
01:06:11,183 --> 01:06:15,040

1727
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,290
PROFESSOR 2: Thank you.

1728
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,610

1729
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:19,850
AUDIENCE: I just want to say
that this was like--

1730
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,010
should I take it?

1731
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,730
PROFESSOR 1: Sure.

1732
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:21,950
AUDIENCE: OK.

1733
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,330
That this was like
an amazing class.

1734
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,100
I think everyone can agree that
we learned so much that

1735
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,060
is not found in textbooks.

1736
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,750
And what I thought was really
weird is that every little

1737
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:35,480
random thing I've ever read
on the internet related to

1738
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,440
coding, I guess, has come up in
this class in like, useful,

1739
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,610
come up like useful
in this class.

1740
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:42,550
Like every little bit of outside
knowledge that you

1741
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:46,240
take yourself has appeared
useful in this class later on.

1742
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,480
And I thought was really cool.

1743
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,850
And related to the hardness that
people are talking about.

1744
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:54,970
I think everyone came into the
class bracing for the absolute

1745
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,610
worst, because we've heard
about you guys.

1746
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:00,610
[LAUGHTER]

1747
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:02,340
AUDIENCE: But, yeah.

1748
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,190
I was actually really pleasantly
surprised that

1749
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:11,400
there were helpful TAs waiting
in the G7 lounge for you, even

1750
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,020
before office hours start.

1751
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,580
And so I was actually really
pleasantly surprised by--

1752
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:17,630
just like everyone, the class.

1753
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,960
I feel like everyone who has
survived until this point has

1754
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,690
some sort of magic skill.

1755
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,560
That you really learn a lot
by working with them

1756
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,110
on the group projects.

1757
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:29,890
And so I was just
really inspired.

1758
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:31,610
And I thought it was
a great class.

1759
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:32,030
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

1760
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:32,886
PROFESSOR 2: Thank you.

1761
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,600
[APPLAUSE]

1762
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,850
AUDIENCE: Hi.

1763
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,480

1764
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,280
I love the class.

1765
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,600
I appreciate you Professor
Leiserson, and everything that

1766
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,800
everybody else before me said.

1767
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,960
I just wanted to mention
two things I

1768
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,730
don't think were mentioned.

1769
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:51,680
Beta programming, to be honest,
was amazing because

1770
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,230
except the final project,
everything I did was beta

1771
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,920
programming in the projects.

1772
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,470
And the amount of bugs that we
avoided because of that is

1773
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:00,990
ridiculous.

1774
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,990
Especially when we're doing
pointers, and if it doesn't

1775
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:07,400
work, make it a pointer, and all
those philosophies that we

1776
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,500
came up with.

1777
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,110
That's the first thing.

1778
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:14,140
Second thing is, and I've
already mentioned this.

1779
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:17,220
A book or readings for
this class or links.

1780
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:20,859
Because as amazing as the
lecture slides are, a lot of

1781
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:22,979
work done there, so
thanks a lot.

1782
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:25,370
They're hard to connect
together, especially when

1783
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,656
you're trying to figure out
what our cache-oblivious

1784
01:08:26,656 --> 01:08:32,270
algorithm is trying
to do with those.

1785
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,278
So that's pretty much it.

1786
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:37,149

1787
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:38,760
Are you telling me the
stack overflow is as

1788
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,600
much as this course?

1789
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,479
Well, thanks a lot again
for the TAs.

1790
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:46,184
Most of my learning came from
them, to be honest.

1791
01:08:46,184 --> 01:08:48,112
[LAUGHTER]

1792
01:08:48,112 --> 01:08:51,979
[APPLAUSE]

1793
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:53,060
AUDIENCE: Hands on learning.

1794
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,220
Hands on.

1795
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:58,140
Thank you.

1796
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:58,399
[LAUGHTER]

1797
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,020
GUEST SPEAKER: Hi.

1798
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,130
my name is Harold Pokob,
I'm the head of

1799
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:03,930
engineering at Akamai.

1800
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:06,700
So I wanted to use the
opportunity to thank all of

1801
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,029
you for taking the class.

1802
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:14,250
Charles was my adviser when I
was at MIT and he told me

1803
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,649
about his plans for the class.

1804
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:17,229
I thought it was a great idea.

1805
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:22,910
Getting a lot more hands-on
experience going.

1806
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,290
Back when I spent time at MIT,
it was a lot more theory, and

1807
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:30,870
Scheme was one of the main
programming languages.

1808
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:36,029
So in that context I really
like this type of class.

1809
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:40,359
And I'm glad MIT is investing
in that and

1810
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:41,800
supported from Akamai.

1811
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,660
So I'm honored that we
could sponsor it.

1812
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,630
I'm very happy you're here.

1813
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:48,010
There is, I think, refreshments
downstairs in a

1814
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:48,474
few minutes.

1815
01:09:48,474 --> 01:09:48,760
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah.

1816
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:54,560
I'd also like to ask Harold to
say what the topic of his

1817
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,282
master's thesis was.

1818
01:09:56,282 --> 01:09:57,545
[LAUGHTER]

1819
01:09:57,545 --> 01:10:00,340
GUEST SPEAKER: My master's
thesis was cache oblivious

1820
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,600
algorithms.

1821
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,360
[LAUGHTER]

1822
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,280
PROFESSOR 2: So you have Harold
to thank for one of the

1823
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,770
papers that you read
during the term.

1824
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,480
GUEST SPEAKER: It's nice that
something that I did in

1825
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,740
academia is still used.

1826
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:19,950
Not all now practical business
stuff that I do these days.

1827
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,770

1828
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,650
Great to have you here, and
I hope to see some of you

1829
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:26,320
downstairs.

1830
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,950
And I've got to actually go
into a meeting at 4:00 for

1831
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,570
half an hour, but I'll be
back down afterwards.

1832
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:32,250
Thank you.

1833
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,180
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you very much
for sponsoring this event

1834
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,840
and getting all the food.

1835
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,310
[APPLAUSE]

1836
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:39,223
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

1837
01:10:39,223 --> 01:10:41,230
Now we have food.

1838
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,330
AUDIENCE: We also have
quizzes here.

1839
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,880
